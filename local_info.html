              <p style="text-align: left;">
              From Canberra airport, the easiest way to access the conference venue is utilising a car or taxi, which takes approximately 6 minutes. The conference venue is also accessible from the airport utilising public transport, via the route 5 then route 30 bus. This takes approximately 30 minutes. An Uber from UNSW Canberra/ADFA to the airport costs approx $12-$15.

          <br/>

          Public transport in Canberra (bus and light rail along Northbourne Avenue) can be paid for utilsing cash fares or a MyWay card; however, the latter is recommended due to the lower fares, which are listed <a href="https://www.transport.act.gov.au/tickets-and-myway/fares"> here</a>. For adult passengers, a single MyWay trip costs $3.22, and the corresponding cash fare is $5.00.
